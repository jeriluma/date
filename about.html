				<h1>About PMD</h1>

				<h2>What is PMD?</h2>
				<p>
					PMD (Plan My Date) is a date searching service. PMD finds food and event date combinations for you and your loved one.
				</p>

					Who? When/Where? Why?

					why is it better...
					How is it unique? 
					What does it do that other apps don't do?	
				</p>

				<h2>How Does PMD Work?</h2>
				<p>
					First PMD uses user input about a Location, a Food, and an Event. PMD first searches for a food place in a given location, then using that food place's location, searches for an event near by. If PMD can't find results within the set user parameters, PMD will find other relevant results.
				</p>

				</p>
				<p>
					The reason for basing dates off of food places first is due to the API calling restrictions. Google Places sets a low limit on calling their API, compared to the unlimited calls for Eventful.
				</p>
				<p>
					I used the Google Places API to find "Restaurants in LOCATION". Google Places API is similar to Yelp, where document places's ratings and other factors. Google Places is based off Zagat which collects restaurant ratings. To properly use this API, from the front-end I send an AJAX request to my own server in the back-end, which then calls upon Google Places, and sends back information to the front-end. From there, JSON data is parsed through using templates/containers to display information.
				</p>
				<p>
					I used the Eventful API to search for events based on a food place's location, a user's preference, and a user's input data about date and time. Eventful keeps track of real time events, so event suggestions are always current. Using the Eventful API was simpler than Google Places, in which that I could send a direct AJAX request to Eventful to receive JSON data to parse to display information in the front-end.
				</p>
				<p>
					By default, PMD searches for highly rated restaraunts in Seattle and events happening that day.
				</p>

				<h2>PMD User Interface</h2>
				<p>
					I was very inspired by <a href="https://www.virginamerica.com/">Virgin America</a> to create this user interface. I loved their simple, minimalistic, flat design that was colorful but not overbearing.

					I wanted a color pallet that emulates affection and love, so I choose a <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/1387198/good_tea_morning">Good Morning Tea</a> Pallet.
				</p>
		
				<h2>PMD Features</h2>
				<h3>Random Dates</h3>
				<p>
					If you can't decide what kind of dates to search for...there's a search form to help you decide your date. Or you could input no information into the search boxes and get random date ideas.
				</p>
				<h3>Reservations</h3>
				<p>
					Did you find a date idea? Great! You can reserve via Eventful that event by clicking on it's title!
